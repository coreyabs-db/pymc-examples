    "## Statistical versus interventional distributions\n",
    "So far this has been quite high-level, but let's try to pin this down a little. In our example, if we were to take a purely statistical approach we could ask \"What happened when interest rates were 2%?\" This is a statistical question because we are basically looking back in our dataset and filtering (or conditioning) upon time points where interest rates were at (or very close to) 2%. So let's flag up - **conditional distributions are purely statistical quantities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the real question we might want an answer to is \"What would have happened in the past if we had set the interest rates to 2%?\" or \"What will happen going forward if we set the interest rates to 2%?\" Despite the subtle changing of wording, this now radically changes what we have to do in order to answer the question. So a key point here is **interventional distributions require causal (not statistical) approaches**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interventional distributions are cool because they allow us to ask what-if (or counterfactual questions). For example, with a causal DAG we could ask questions of the form, \"What do I think will happen in the future if I do X?\" or \"What do I think would have happened in the past if X had happened?\" See how these types of questions have a very different flavour to purely statistical kinds of questions - they would be more like \"Given what I've seen, what do I think will happen.\" See how this has a more passive, observational focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "From hereon, the main point of this notebook will be to provide some understanding and intuition about the differences between conditional and interventional distributions, and how to estimate interventional distributions with PyMC.

The $\\operatorname{do}$ operator implements an intervention that we want to make. It consists of 2 simple steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to describe this new interventional distribution we need truncated factorization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{card} Truncated factorization\n",
    "{cite:t}`pearl2000causality` describes truncated factorization as follows. If we have a probability distribution $P(v)$ on a set of $V$ variables, then $P_x(v)$ is the interventional distribution that results from $\\operatorname{do}(X=x)$ that sets a subset of $X$ variables to constants $x$. Then we can describe the interventional distribution with truncated factorization as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Interested readers are referred to section 1.3 of {cite:t}`pearl2000causality` on Causal Bayesian Networks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying that to the spinkler example, we can define the _interventional distribution_ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x_1, x_2, \\operatorname{do}(x_3=1), x_4, x_5) = P(x_1) P(x_2|x_1) P(x_4|x_3=1, x_2) P(x_5|x_4)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important changes here:\n",
    "1. Note that $x_3$ was previously a random variable, but this has now been 'locked' at a particular value, $x_3=1$, because of our intervention.\n",
    "2. Note the absense of the $P(x_3|x_1)$ term, because $x_1$ no longer has any causal influence over $x_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, this is pretty cool. We can use the $\\operatorname{do}$ operator to make in intervention in our model of the world. We can then observe the consequences of this intervention and make much better predictions of what will happen when we are active and intervene (actually or hypothetically) in the world. The accuracy is of course subject to how well our causal DAG reflects the real processes in the world.\n",
