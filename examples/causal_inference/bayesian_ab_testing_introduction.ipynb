    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a Bayesian analysis of an A/B test. We implement the models discussed in VWO's Bayesian A/B Testing Whitepaper {cite:p}`stucchio2015bayesian`, and discuss the effect of different prior choices for these models. This notebook does _not_ discuss other related topics like how to choose a prior, early stopping, and power analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is A/B testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "From https://vwo.com/ab-testing/:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a process of showing two variants of the same web page to different segments of website visitors at the same time and comparing which variant drives more conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, A/B tests are often used in the software industry to determine whether a new feature or changes to an existing feature should be released to users, and the impact of the change on core product metrics (\"conversions\"). Furthermore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can test more than two variants at the same time. We'll be dealing with how to analyse these tests in this notebook as well.\n",
    "* Exactly what \"conversions\" means can vary between tests, but two classes of conversions we'll focus on are:\n",
    "  * Bernoulli conversions - a flag for whether the visitor did the target action or not (e.g. completed at least one purchase).\n",
    "  * Value conversions - a real value per visitor (e.g. the dollar revenue, which could also be 0).\n",
    " \n",
    "If you've studied [controlled experiments](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-biology-foundations/hs-biology-and-the-scientific-method/a/experiments-and-observations) in the context of biology, psychology, and other sciences before, A/B testing will sound a lot like a controlled experiment - and that's because it is! The concept of a control group and treatment groups, and the principles of experimental design, are the building blocks of A/B testing. The main difference is the context in which the experiment is run: A/B tests are typically run by online software companies, where the subjects are visitors to the website / app, the outcomes of interest are behaviours that can be tracked like signing up, purchasing a product, and returning to the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B tests are typically analysed with traditional hypothesis tests (see [t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)), but another method is to use Bayesian statistics. This allows us to incorporate prior distributions and produce a range of outcomes to the questions \"is there a winning variant?\" and \"by how much?\"."

    "Let's first deal with a simple two-variant A/B test, where the metric of interest is the proportion of users performing an action (e.g. purchase at least one item), a bernoulli conversion. Our variants are called A and B, where A refers to the existing landing page and B refers to the new page we want to test. The outcome that we want to perform statistical inference on is whether B is \"better\" than A, which is depends on the underlying \"true\" conversion rates for each variant. We can formulate this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\theta_A, \\theta_B$ be the true conversion rates for variants A and B respectively. Then the outcome of whether a visitor converts in variant A is the random variable $\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\theta_A)$, and $\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\theta_B)$ for variant B. If we assume that visitors' behaviour on the landing page is independent of other visitors (a fair assumption), then the total conversions $y$ for a variant has the Binomial distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y \\sim \\sum^N\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\theta) = \\mathrm{Binomial}(N, \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under a Bayesian framework, we assume the true conversion rates $\\theta_A, \\theta_B$ cannot be known, and instead they each follow a Beta distribution. The underlying rates are assumed to be independent (we would split traffic between each variant randomly, so one variant would not affect the other): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_A \\sim \\theta_B \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed data for the duration of the A/B test (the likelihoood distribution) is: the number of visitors landing on the page `N`, and the number of visitors purchasing at least one item `y`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_A \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n = N_A, p = \\theta_A), y_B \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n = N_B, p = \\theta_B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can sample from the joint posterior of $\\theta_A, \\theta_B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Binomial, so we don't need MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior (the exact solution can be found in the VWO paper). We'll still demonstrate how sampling can be done with PyMC though, and doing this makes it easier to extend the model with different priors, dependency assumptions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, remember that our outcome of interest is whether B is better than A. A common measure in practice for whether B is better than is the _relative uplift in conversion rates_, i.e. the percentage difference of $\\theta_B$ over $\\theta_A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{reluplift}_B = \\theta_B / \\theta_A - 1$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* We assume that the same Beta prior is set for each variant.\n",
    "* An _uninformative_ or _weakly informative_ prior occurs when we set low values for `alpha` and `beta`. For example, `alpha = 1, beta = 1` leads to a uniform distribution as a prior. If we were considering one distribution in isolation, setting this prior is a statement that we don't know anything about the value of the parameter, nor our confidence around it. In the context of A/B testing however, we're interested in comparing the _relative uplift_ of one variant over another. With a weakly informative Beta prior, this relative uplift distribution is very wide, so we're implicitly saying that the variants could be very different to each other.\n",
    "* A _strong_ prior occurs when we set high values for `alpha` and `beta`. Contrary to the above, a strong prior would imply that the relative uplift distribution is thin, i.e. our prior belief is that the variants are not very different from each other.\n",

For example, a visitor in one variant could spend thousands of dollars, and the observed revenue data no longer follows a 'nice' distribution like Gamma. It's common to impute these outliers prior to running a statistical analysis (we have to be careful with removing them altogether, as this could bias the inference), or fall back to bernoulli conversions for decision making."

    "* How do we choose our prior distributions? \n",
    "* In practice, people look at A/B test results every day, not only once at the end of the test. How do we balance finding true differences faster vs. minizing false discoveries (the 'early stopping' problem)?\n",
    "* How do we plan the length and size of A/B tests using power analysis, if we're using Bayesian models to analyse the results?\n",
