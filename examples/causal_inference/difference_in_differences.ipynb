    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief overview of the difference in differences approach to causal inference, and shows a working example of how to conduct this type of analysis under the Bayesian framework, using PyMC. While the notebooks provides a high level overview of the approach, I recommend consulting two excellent textbooks on causal inference. Both [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/) {cite:p}`huntington2021effect` and [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com) {cite:p}`cunningham2021causal` have chapters devoted to difference in differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Difference in differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_in_differences) would be a good approach to take for causal inference if:\n",
    "* you want to know the causal impact of a treatment/intervention\n",
    "* you have pre and post treatment measures\n",
    "* you have both a treatment and a control group\n",
    "* the treatment was _not_ allocated by randomisation, that is, you are in a [quasi-experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-experiment) setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise there are likely better suited approaches you could use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our desire to estimate the causal impact of a treatment involves [counterfactual thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_thinking). This is because we are asking \"What would the post-treatment outcome of the treatment group be _if_ treatment had not been administered?\" but we can never observe this."

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example is given by a study by {cite:t}`card1993minimum`. This study examined the effects of increasing the minimum wage upon employment in the fast food sector. This is a quasi-experimental setting because the intervention (increase in minimum wages) was not applied to different geographical units (e.g. states) randomly. The intevention was applied to New Jersey in April 1992. If they measured pre and post intervention employment rates in New Jersey only, then they would have failed to control for omitted variables changing over time (e.g. seasonal effects) which could provide alternative causal explanations for changes in employment rates. But by selecting a control state (Pennsylvania), this allows one to infer that changes in employment in Pennsylvania would match the counterfactual - what _would have happened if_ New Jersey had not received the intervention?"

    "### Causal DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal DAG for difference in differences is given below. It says:\n",
    "* Treatment status of an observation is causally influenced by group and time. Note that treatment and group are different things. Group is either experimental or control, but the experimental group is only 'treated' after the intervention time, hence treatment status depends on both group and time.\n",
    "* The outcome measured is causally influenced by time, group, and treatment.\n",
    "* No additional causal influences are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily interested in the effect of the treatment upon the outcome and how this changes over time (pre to post treatment). If we only focused on treatment, time and outcome on the treatment group (i.e. not have a control group), then we would be unable to attribute changes in the outcome to the treatment rather than any number of other factors occurring over time to the treatment group. Another way of saying this is that treatment would be fully determined by time, so there is no way to disambiguate the changes in the pre and post outcome measures as being caused by treatment or time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](DAG_difference_in_differences.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But by adding a control group, we are able to compare the changes in time of the control group and the changes in time of the treatment group. One of the key assumptions in the difference in differences approach is the _parallel trends assumption_ - that both groups change in similar ways over time. Another way of saying this is that _if_ the control and treatment groups change in similar ways over time, then we can be fairly convinced that difference in differences in groups over time is due to the treatment."

    "### Posterior prediction\n",
    "NOTE: Technically we are doing 'pushforward prediction' for $\\mu$ as this is a deterministic function of it's inputs. Posterior prediction would be a more appropriate label if we generated predicted observations - these would be stochastic based on the normal likelihood we've specified for our data. Nevertheless, this section is called 'posterior prediction' to emphasise the fact that we are following the Bayesian workflow."

By definition, we never made any observations of items in the treatment group that were not treated after the intervention time. Nevertheless, with the model described at the top of the notebook and the Bayesian inference methods outlined, we can reason about such _what if_ questions. \n",

    "Of course, when using the difference in differences approach for real applications, there is a lot more due diligence that's needed. Readers are encouraged to check out the textbooks listed above in the introduction as well as a useful review paper {cite:p}`wing2018designing` which covers the important contextual issues in more detail. Additionally, {cite:t}`bertrand2004much` takes a skeptical look at the approach as well as proposing solutions to some of the problems they highlight."
