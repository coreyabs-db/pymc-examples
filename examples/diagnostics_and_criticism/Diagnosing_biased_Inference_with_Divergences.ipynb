However, a naive or direct parameterization of our probability model can sometimes be ineffective, you can check out Thomas Wiecki's blog post, [Why hierarchical models are awesome, tricky, and Bayesian](http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/02/08/bayesian-hierchical-non-centered/) on the same issue in PyMC3. Suboptimal parameterization often leads to slow sampling, and more problematic, biased MCMC estimators. \n",

This fast convergence requires strong ergodicity conditions to hold, in particular geometric ergodicity between a Markov transition and a target distribution. Geometric ergodicity is usually the necessary condition for MCMC estimators to follow a central limit theorem, which ensures not only that they are unbiased even after only a finite number of iterations but also that we can empirically quantify their precision using the MCMC standard error.\n",

    "Unfortunately, proving geometric ergodicity is infeasible for any nontrivial problem. Instead we must rely on empirical diagnostics that identify obstructions to geometric ergodicity, and hence well-behaved MCMC estimators. For a general Markov transition and target distribution, the best known diagnostic is the split $\\hat{R}$ statistic over an ensemble of Markov chains initialized from diffuse points in parameter space; to do any better we need to exploit the particular structure of a given transition or target distribution.\n",
    " \n",
    "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, for example, is especially powerful in this regard as its failures to be geometrically ergodic with respect to any target distribution manifest in distinct behaviors that have been developed into sensitive diagnostics. One of these behaviors is the appearance of divergences that indicate the Hamiltonian Markov chain has encountered regions of high curvature in the target distribution which it cannot adequately explore.\n",

This odd behavior is a clear sign that something problematic is afoot. As shown in the trace plot, the chain occasionally \"sticks\" as it approaches small values of $\\tau$, exactly where we saw the divergences concentrating. This is a clear indication of the underlying pathologies. These sticky intervals induce severe oscillations in the MCMC estimators early on, until they seem to finally settle into biased values.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact the sticky intervals are the Markov chain trying to correct the biased exploration. If we ran the chain even longer then it would eventually get stuck again and drag the MCMC estimator down towards the true value. Given an infinite number of iterations this delicate balance asymptotes to the true expectation as weâ€™d expect given the consistency guarantee of MCMC. Stopping after any finite number of iterations, however, destroys this balance and leaves us with a significant bias. \n",

    "## Mitigating Divergences by Adjusting PyMC3's Adaptation Routine\n",
    "\n",
    "Divergences in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo arise when the Hamiltonian transition encounters regions of extremely large curvature, such as the opening of the hierarchical funnel. Unable to accurate resolve these regions, the transition malfunctions and flies off towards infinity. With the transitions unable to completely explore these regions of extreme curvature, we lose geometric ergodicity and our MCMC estimators become biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm implemented in `Stan` uses a heuristic to quickly identify these misbehaving trajectories, and hence label divergences, without having to wait for them to run all the way to infinity. This heuristic can be a bit aggressive, however, and sometimes label transitions as divergent even when we have not lost geometric ergodicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this potential ambiguity we can adjust the step size, $\\epsilon$, of the Hamiltonian transition. The smaller the step size the more accurate the trajectory and the less likely it will be mislabeled as a divergence. In other words, if we have geometric ergodicity between the Hamiltonian transition and the target distribution then decreasing the step size will reduce and then ultimately remove the divergences entirely. If we do not have geometric ergodicity, however, then decreasing the step size will not completely remove the divergences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `Stan`, the step size in `PyMC3` is tuned automatically during warm up, but we can coerce smaller step sizes by tweaking the configuration of `PyMC3`'s adaptation routine. In particular, we can increase the `target_accept` parameter from its default value of 0.8 closer to its maximum value of 1."
