    "So we might infer from this that counties with higher proportions of houses without basements tend to have higher baseline levels of radon. This seems to be new, as up to this point we saw that `floor` was *negatively* associated with radon levels. But remember this was at the household-level: radon tends to be higher in houses with basements. But at the county-level it seems that the less basements on average in the county, the more radon. So it's not that contradictory. What's more, the estimate for $\\gamma_2$ is quite uncertain and overlaps with zero, so it's possible that the relationship is not that strong. And finally, let's note that $\\gamma_2$ estimates something else than uranium's effect, as this is already taken into account by $\\gamma_1$ -- it answers the question \"once we know uranium level in the county, is there any value in learning about the proportion of houses without basements?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to say that we shouldn't interpret this causally: there is no credible mechanism by which a basement (or absence thereof) *causes* radon emissions. More probably, our causal graph is missing something: a confounding variable, one that influences both basement construction and radon levels, is lurking somewhere in the dark... Perhaps is it the type of soil, which might influence what type of structures are built *and* the level of radon? Maybe adding this to our model would help with causal inference."
