    "  \n",
    "In this blog post I will write about:\n",
    "\n",
    " - How a few outliers can largely affect the fit of linear regression models.\n",
    " - How replacing the normal likelihood with Student T distribution produces robust regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the {ref}`linear regression tutorial <pymc:GLM_linear>` I described how minimizing the squared distance of the regression line is the same as maximizing the likelihood of a Normal distribution with the mean coming from the regression line. This latter probabilistic expression allows us to easily formulate a Bayesian linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This worked splendidly on simulated data. The problem with simulated data though is that it's, well, simulated. In the real world things tend to get more messy and assumptions like normality are easily violated by a few outliers. \n",

    "Lets see what happens if we add some outliers to our simulated data from the last post."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    " - By changing the likelihood from a Normal distribution to a Student T distribution -- which has more mass in the tails -- we can perform *Robust Regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Extensions*: \n",
    "\n",
    " - The Student-T distribution has, besides the mean and variance, a third parameter called *degrees of freedom* that describes how much mass should be put into the tails. Here it is set to 1 which gives maximum mass to the tails (setting this to infinity results in a Normal distribution!). One could easily place a prior on this rather than fixing it which I leave as an exercise for the reader ;).\n",
    " - T distributions can be used as priors as well. See {ref}`GLM-hierarchical`\n",
    " - How do we test if our data is normal or violates that assumption in an important way? Check out this great blog post, [Probably Overthinking It](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2013/08/are-my-data-normal.html), by Allen Downey."
