Firstly, if the truncation or censoring bounds are very broad such that they only affect a few data points, then the underestimation bias would be smaller. Secondly, if the measurement error `σ` is low, we might expect the underestimation bias to decrease. In the limit of zero measurement noise then it should be possible to fully recover the true slope for truncated data but there will always be some bias in the censored case. Regardless, it would be prudent to use truncated or censored regression models unless the measurement error is near zero, or the bounds are so broad as to be practically irrelevant."
