    "To better understand BART in practice we are going to use the oldie but goldie coal mining disaster dataset. One of the classic examples in PyMC. Instead of thinking this problem as a switch-point model with two Poisson distribution, as in the original PyMC example. We are going to think this problem as a non-parametric regression with a Poisson response (this is usually discussed in terms of [Poisson processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process) or [Cox processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_process), but we are OK without going into those technicalities). For a similar example but with Gaussian processes see [1](https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP/blob/master/code/Chp7/07_Gaussian%20process.ipynb) or [2](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/software/gpstuff/demo_lgcp.shtml). Because our data is just a single column with dates, we need to do some pre-processing. We are going to discretize the data, just as if we were building a histogram. We are going to use the centers of the bins as the variable $X$ and the counts per bin as the variable $Y$"

    "Before checking the result, we need to discuss one more detail, the BART variable always samples over the real line, meaning that in principle we can get values that go from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$. Thus, we may need to transform their values as we would do for standard Generalized Linear Models, for example in the `model_coal` we computed `pm.math.exp(μ_)` because the Poisson distribution is expecting values that go from 0 to $\\infty$. This is business as usual, the novelty is that we may need to apply the inverse transformation to the values of `Y`, as we did in the previous model where we took $\\log(Y)$. The main reason to do this is that the values of `Y` are used to get a reasonable initial value for the sum of trees and also the variance of the leaf nodes. Thus, applying the inverse transformation is a simple way to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the result. Should we do this for every possible likelihood? Well, no. If we are using BART for the location parameter of distributions like Normal, StudentT, or AssymetricLaplace, we don't need to do anything as the support of these parameters is also the real line. A nontrivial exception is the Bernoulli likelihood (or Binomial with n=1), in that case, we need to apply the logistic function to the BART variable, but there is no need to apply its inverse to transform `Y`, PyMC-BART already takes care of that particular case.\n",

In practice, this is often the case because we sum over many trees, usually values like 50, 100, or 200.\n",

    "In the BART literature, the diagnostics of the BART variables is sometimes considered less important than the diagnostics of the non-BART variables, the main argument is that the individual estimates of the latent variables are of no direct interest, and instead we should only care about how well we are estimating the whole function/regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We instead consider checking the convergence of BART variables an important part of the Bayesian workflow. The main reason to use `pmb.plot_convergence` is that usually the BART variable will be a large vector (we estimate a distribution per observation) and thus we will need to check a large number of diagnostics. Additionally, the R-hat threshold of 1.01 is not a hard threshold, this value was chosen assuming one or a few R-hats are examined (and chains are long enough to accurately estimate their autocorrelation), and if we observed a large number of R-hat a few of them are expected to be larger than the 1.01 threshold (or whatever threshold we pick) even if there is nothing wrong with our inference. For that reason, a fair analysis should include a multiple comparison adjustment, and that's what `pmb.plot_convergence` does automatically for you. So, how to read its output? We have two panels one for ESS and one for the R-hat. The blue line is the empirical cumulative distribution for those values, for the ESS we want the entire curve above the dashed line, and for R-hat we want the curve to be entirely below the dashed line. In the previous figure, we can see that we barely make it for the ESS and for the R-hat we have very few values above the threshold. Are our results useless? Most likely not. But to be sure we may want to take a few more draws.  "

    "\n",
    "When interpreting partial dependence plots we should be careful about the assumptions in this plot. First, we assume that variables are independent. For example when computing the effect of `hour` we have to marginalize the effect of `temperature` and this means that to compute the partial dependence value at `hour=0` we are including all observed values of temperature, and this may include temperatures that are not observed at midnight, given that lower temperatures are more likely than higher ones. We are seeing only averages, so if for a covariate half the values are positively associated with the predicted variable and the other half negatively associated. The partial dependence plot will be flat as their contributions will cancel each other out. This is a problem that can be solved by using individual conditional expectation plots `pmb.plot_ice(...)`. Notice that all these assumptions are assumptions of the partial dependence plot, not of our model! In fact, BART can easily accommodate interactions of variables Although the prior in BART regularizes high-order interactions). For more on interpreting Machine Learning models, you could check the \"Interpretable Machine Learning\" book {cite:p}`molnar2019`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, like with other regression methods, we should be careful that the effects we are seeing on individual variables are conditional on the inclusion of the other variables. So for example, while `humidity` seems to be mostly flat, meaning that this covariate has a small effect on the number of used bikes. This could be the case because `humidity` and `temperature` are correlated to some extent and once we include `temperature` in our model `humidity` does not provide too much extra information. Try for example fitting the model again but this time with `humidity` as the single covariate and then fitting the model again with `hour` as a single covariate. You should see that the result for this single-variate model will be very similar to the previous figure for the `hour` covariate, but less similar for the `humidity` covariate."

    "This plot helps us understand the reason behind the bad performance on the test set: Recall that in the variable importance ranking from the initial model we saw that `hour` was the most important predictor. On the other hand, our training data just sees `hour` values until $19$ (since is our train-test threshold). As BART learns how to partition the (training) data, it can not differentiate between `hour` values between $20$ and $22$ for example. It just cares that both values are greater that $19$. This is very important to understand when using BART! This explains why one should not use BART for time series forecasting if there is a trend component. In this case it is better to detrend the data first, model the remainder with BART and model the trend with a different model."
