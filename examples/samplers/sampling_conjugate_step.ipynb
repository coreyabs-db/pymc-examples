    "Sampling methods based on Monte Carlo are extremely widely used in Bayesian inference, and PyMC3 uses a powerful version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to efficiently sample from posterior distributions over many hundreds or thousands of parameters. HMC is a generic inference algorithm in the sense that you do not need to assume specific prior distributions (like an inverse-Gamma prior on the conditional variance of a regression model) or likelihood functions. In general, the product of a prior and likelihood will not easily be integrated in closed form, so we can't derive the form of the posterior with pen and paper. HMC is widely regarded as a major improvement over previous Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms because it uses gradients of the model's log posterior density to make informed proposals in parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these gradient computations can often be expensive for models with especially complicated functional dependencies between variables and observed data. When this is the case, we may wish to find a faster sampling scheme by making use of additional structure in some portions of the model. When a number of variables within the model are *conjugate*, the conditional posterior--that is, the posterior distribution holding all other model variables fixed--can often be sampled from very easily. This suggests using a HMC-within-Gibbs step in which we alternate between using cheap conjugate sampling for variables when possible, and using more expensive HMC for the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, it is not advisable to pick *any* alternative sampling method and use it to replace HMC. This combination often yields much worse performance in terms of *effective* sampling rates, even if the individual samples are drawn much more rapidly. In this notebook, we show how to implement a conjugate sampling scheme in PyMC3 and compare it against a full-HMC (or, in this case, NUTS) approach. For this case, we find that using conjugate sampling can dramatically speed up computations for a Dirichlet-multinomial model."
