    "### The MLDA sampler\n",
    "This notebook is a good starting point to understand the basic usage of the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance MCMC algorithm (MLDA) proposed in [1], as implemented within PyMC.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a simple linear regression model (and a toy coarse model counterpart) to show the basic workflow when using MLDA. The model is similar to the one used in {ref}`pymc:glm_linear`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLDA sampler is designed to deal with computationally intensive problems where we have access not only to the desired (fine) posterior distribution but also to a set of approximate (coarse) posteriors of decreasing accuracy and decreasing computational cost (we need at least one of those). Its main idea is that coarser chains' samples are used as proposals for the finer chains. A coarse chain runs for a fixed number of iterations and the last sample is used as a proposal for the finer chain. This has been shown to improve the effective sample size of the finest chain and this allows us to reduce the number of expensive fine-chain likelihood evaluations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PyMC implementation supports:\n",
    "- Any number of levels\n",
    "- Two types of bottom-level samplers (Metropolis, DEMetropolisZ)\n",
    "- Various tuning parameters for the bottom-level samplers\n",
    "- Separate subsampling rates for each level\n",
    "- A choice between blocked and compound sampling for bottom-level Metropolis. \n",
    "- An adaptive error model to correct bias between coarse and fine models \n",
    "- A variance reduction technique that utilizes samples from all chains to reduce the variance of an estimated quantity of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about the MLDA sampler and the way it should be used and parameterised, the user can refer to the docstrings in the code and to the other example notebooks which deal with more complex problem settings and more advanced MLDA features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the MLDA sampler is new in PyMC. The user should be extra critical about the results and report any problems as issues in the PyMC's github repository.\n",

    "**Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see from the summary statistics above that MLDA's ESS is ~13x higher than Metropolis and ~2.5x higher than DEMetropolisZ. The runtime of MLDA is ~3.5x larger than either Metropolis or DEMetropolisZ. Therefore in this toy example MLDA is almost an overkill (especially compared to DEMetropolisZ). For more complex problems, where the difference in computational cost between the coarse and fine models/likelihoods is orders of magnitude, MLDA is expected to outperform the other two samplers, as long as the coarse model is reasonably close to the fine one. This case is often encountered in inverse problems in engineering, ecology, imaging, etc where a forward model can be defined with varying coarseness in space and/or time (e.g. subsurface water flow, predator prey models, etc). For an example of this, please see the `MLDA_gravity_surveying.ipynb notebook` in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subsampling rate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLDA sampler is based on the assumption that the coarse proposal samples (i.e. the samples proposed from the coarse chain to the fine one) are independent (or almost independent) from each other. In order to generate independent samples, it is necessary to run the coarse chain for an adequate number of iterations to get rid of autocorrelation. Therefore, the higher the autocorrelation in the coarse chain, the more iterations are needed and the larger the subsampling rate should be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Values larger than the minimum for beating autocorreletion can further improve the proposal (as the distribution is explored better and the proposal are imptoved), and thus ESS. But at the same time more steps cost more computationally. Users are encouraged to do test runs with different subsampling rates to understand which gives the best ESS/sec. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in cases where you have more than one coarse model/level, MLDA allows you to choose a different subsampling rate for each coarse level (as a list of integers when you instantiate the stepper)."
