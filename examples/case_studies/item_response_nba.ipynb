    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial shows an application of Bayesian Item Response Theory {cite:p}`fox2010bayesian` to NBA basketball foul calls data using PyMC. Based on Austin Rochford's blogpost [NBA Foul Calls and Bayesian Item Response Theory](https://www.austinrochford.com/posts/2017-04-04-nba-irt.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Our scenario is that we observe a binary outcome (a foul being called or not) from an interaction (a basketball play) of two agents with two different roles (the player committing the alleged foul and the player disadvantaged in the play). Moreover, each committing or disadvantaged agent is an individual which might be observed several times (say LeBron James observed committing a foul in more than one play). Then it might be that not only the agent's role, but also the abilities of the single individual player contribute to the observed outcome. And so we'd like to __estimate the contribution to the observed outcome of each individual's (latent) ability as a committing or disadvantaged agent.__ This would allow us, for example, to rank players from more to less effective, quantify uncertainty in this ranking and discover extra hierarchical structures involved in foul calls. All pretty useful stuff! \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we study this common and complex __multi-agent interaction__ scenario, with __hierarchical__ structures between  more than a thousand individuals? \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the scenario's overwhelming complexity, Bayesian Item Response Theory combined with modern powerful statistical software allows for quite elegant and effective modeling options. One of these options employs a {term}`Generalized Linear Model` called [Rasch model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasch_model), which we now discuss in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rasch Model\n",
    "We sourced our data from the official [NBA Last Two Minutes Reports](https://official.nba.com/2020-21-nba-officiating-last-two-minute-reports/) with game data between 2015 to 2021. In this dataset, each row `k`  is one play involving two players (the committing and the disadvantaged) where a foul has been either called or not. So we model the probability `p_k` that a referee calls a foul in play `k` as a function of the players involved. Hence we define two latent variables for each player, namely:\n",
    "- `theta`: which estimates the player's ability to have a foul called when disadvantaged, and\n",
    "- `b`: which estimates the player's ability  to have a foul not called when committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the higher these player's parameters, the better the outcome for the player's team. These two parameters are then estimated using a standard Rasch model, by assuming the log-odds-ratio of `p_k` equals `theta-b` for the corresponding players involved in play `k`. Also, we place hierarchical hyperpriors on all `theta`'s and all `b`'s to account for shared abilities between players and largely different numbers of observations for different players.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion \n",
    "Our analysis gives an estimate of the latent skills `theta` and `b` for each player in terms of posterior distributions. We analyze this outcome in three ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first display the role of shared hyperpriors, by showing how posteriors of players with little observations are drawn to the league average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we rank the posteriors by their mean to view best and worst committing and disadvantaged players, and observe that several players still rank in the top 10 of the same model estimated in [Austin Rochford blogpost](https://www.austinrochford.com/posts/2017-04-04-nba-irt.html) on different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we show how we spot that grouping payers by their position is likely to be an informative extra hierarchical layer to introduce in our model, and leave this as an exercise for the interested reader. Let us conclude by mentioning that this opportunity of easily adding informed hierarchical structure to a model is one of the features that makes Bayesian modelling very flexible and powerful for quantifying uncertainty in scenarios where introducing (or discovering) problem-specific knowledge is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this notebook is performed in four main steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data collection and processing.\n",
    "2. Definition and instantiation of the Rasch model. \n",
    "3. Posterior sampling and convergence checks.\n",
    "4. Analysis of the posterior results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data collection and processing\n",
    "We first import data from the original data set, which can be found at [this URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polygraph-cool/last-two-minute-report/32f1c43dfa06c2e7652cc51ea65758007f2a1a01/output/all_games.csv). Each row corresponds to a play between the NBA seasons 2015-16 and 2020-21. We imported only five columns, namely\n",
    "- `committing`: the  name of the committing player in the play.\n",
    "- `disadvantaged`: the name of the disadvantaged player in the play.\n",
    "- `decision`: the reviewed decision of the play, which can take four values, namely:\n",
    "    - `CNC`: correct noncall, `INC`: incorrect noncall, `IC`: incorrect call, `CC`: correct call.\n",
    "- `committing_position`: the position of the committing player which can take values\n",
    "    - `G`: guard, `F`: forward, `C`: center, `G-F`, `F-G`, `F-C`, `C-F`.\n",
    "- `disadvantaged_position`: the position of the disadvantaged player, with possible values as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that we  already removed  from the original  dataset the plays where less than two players are involved (for example travel calls or clock violations). Also, the original dataset does not contain information on the players' position, which we added ourselves."

    "Finally, notice how we worked backwards from our data to construct this model.

Note that, to easily keep track of the players (as we have hundreds of them being both committing and disadvantaged), we make use of the `coords` argument for {class}`pymc.Model`. (For tutorials on this functionality see the notebook {ref}`data_container` or [this blogpost](https://oriolabrilpla.cat/python/arviz/pymc3/xarray/2020/09/22/pymc3-arviz.html).) We choose our priors to be the same as in [Austin Rochford's post](https://www.austinrochford.com/posts/2017-04-04-nba-irt.html), to make the comparison consistent."

    "The histograms above suggest that it might be appropriate to add a hierarchical layer to our model. Namely, group disadvantaged and committing players by the respective positions to account for the role of position in evaluating the latent skills `theta` and `b`. This can be done in our Rasch model by imposing mean and variance hyperpriors for each player grouped by the positions, which is left as an exercise for the reader. To this end, notice that the dataframe `df_orig` is set up precisely to add this hierarchical structure. Have fun!\n",
