    "# Fitting a Reinforcement Learning Model to Behavioral Data with PyMC\n",

    "Reinforcement Learning models are commonly used in behavioral research to model how animals and humans learn, in situtions where they get to make repeated choices that are followed by some form of feedback, such as a reward or a punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will consider the simplest learning scenario, where there are only two possible actions. When an action is taken, it is always followed by an immediate reward. Finally, the outcome of each action is independent from the previous actions taken. This scenario is sometimes referred to as the [multi-armed bandit problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that the two actions (e.g., left and right buttons) are associated with a unit reward 40% and 60% of the time, respectively. At the beginning the learning agent does not know which action $a$ is better, so they may start by assuming both actions have a mean value of 50%. We can store these values in a table, which is usually referred to as a $Q$ table:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      .5, a = \\text{left}\\\\\n",
    "      .5, a = \\text{right}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When an action is chosen and a reward $r = \\{0,1\\}$ is observed, the estimated value of that action is updated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{a} = Q_{a} + \\alpha (r - Q_{a})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ is a learning parameter that influences how much the value of an action is shifted towards the observed reward in each trial. Finally, the $Q$ table values are converted into action probabilities via the softmax transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(a = \\text{right}) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta Q_{\\text{right}})}{\\exp(\\beta Q_{\\text{right}}) + \\exp(\\beta Q_{\\text{left}})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\beta \\in (0, +\\infty)$ parameter determines the level of noise in the agent choices. Larger values will be associated with more deterministic choices and smaller values with increasingly random choices."
