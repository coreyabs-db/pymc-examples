    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "So you are browsing for something to watch on Netflix and just not liking the suggestions. You just know you can do better. All you need to do is collect some ratings data from yourself and friends and build a recommendation algorithm. This notebook will guide you in doing just that!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start out by getting some intuition for how our model will work. Then we'll formalize our intuition. Afterwards, we'll examine the dataset we are going to use. Once we have some notion of what our data looks like, we'll define some baseline methods for predicting preferences for movies. Following that, we'll look at Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), which is a more sophisticated Bayesian method for predicting preferences. Having detailed the PMF model, we'll use PyMC for MAP estimation and MCMC inference. Finally, we'll compare the results obtained with PMF to those obtained from our baseline methods and discuss the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally if we want recommendations for something, we try to find people who are similar to us and ask their opinions. If Bob, Alice, and Monty are all similar to me, and they all like crime dramas, I'll probably like crime dramas. Now this isn't always true. It depends on what we consider to be \"similar\". In order to get the best bang for our buck, we really want to look for people who have the most similar taste. Taste being a complex beast, we'd probably like to break it down into something more understandable. We might try to characterize each movie in terms of various factors. Perhaps films can be moody, light-hearted, cinematic, dialogue-heavy, big-budget, etc. Now imagine we go through IMDB and assign each movie a rating in each of the categories. How moody is it? How much dialogue does it have? What's its budget? Perhaps we use numbers between 0 and 1 for each category. Intuitively, we might call this the film's profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's suppose we go back to those 5 movies we rated. At this point, we can get a richer picture of our own preferences by looking at the film profiles of each of the movies we liked and didn't like. Perhaps we take the averages across the 5 film profiles and call this our ideal type of film. In other words, we have computed some notion of our inherent _preferences_ for various types of movies. Suppose Bob, Alice, and Monty all do the same. Now we can compare our preferences and determine how similar each of us really are. I might find that Bob is the most similar and the other two are still more similar than other people, but not as much as Bob. So I want recommendations from all three people, but when I make my final decision, I'm going to put more weight on Bob's recommendation than those I get from Alice and Monty.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above procedure sounds fairly effective as is, it also reveals an unexpected additional source of information. If we rated a particular movie highly, and we know its film profile, we can compare with the profiles of other movies. If we find one with very close numbers, it is probable we'll also enjoy this movie. Both this approach and the one above are commonly known as _neighborhood approaches_. Techniques that leverage both of these approaches simultaneously are often called _collaborative filtering_ {cite:p}`koren2009matrixfactorization`. The first approach we talked about uses user-user similarity, while the second uses item-item similarity. Ideally, we'd like to use both sources of information. The idea is we have a lot of items available to us, and we'd like to work together with others to filter the list of items down to those we'll each like best. My list should have the items I'll like best at the top and those I'll like least at the bottom. Everyone else wants the same. If I get together with a bunch of other people, we all watch 5 movies, and we have some efficient computational process to determine similarity, we can very quickly order the movies to our liking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take some time to make the intuitive notions we've been discussing more concrete. We have a set of $M$ movies, or _items_ ($M = 100$ in our example above). We also have $N$ people, whom we'll call _users_ of our recommender system. For each item, we'd like to find a $D$ dimensional factor composition (film profile above) to describe the item. Ideally, we'd like to do this without actually going through and manually labeling all of the movies. Manual labeling would be both slow and error-prone, as different people will likely label movies differently. So we model each movie as a $D$ dimensional vector, which is its latent factor composition. Furthermore, we expect each user to have some preferences, but without our manual labeling and averaging procedure, we have to rely on the latent factor compositions to learn $D$ dimensional latent preference vectors for each user. The only thing we get to observe is the $N \\times M$ ratings matrix $R$ provided by the users. Entry $R_{ij}$ is the rating user $i$ gave to item $j$. Many of these entries may be missing, since most users will not have rated all 100 movies. Our goal is to fill in the missing values with predicted ratings based on the latent variables $U$ and $V$. We denote the predicted ratings by $R_{ij}^*$. We also define an indicator matrix $I$, with entry $I_{ij} = 0$ if $R_{ij}$ is missing and $I_{ij} = 1$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have an $N \\times D$ matrix of user preferences which we'll call $U$ and an $M \\times D$ factor composition matrix we'll call $V$. We also have a $N \\times M$ rating matrix we'll call $R$. We can think of each row $U_i$ as indications of how much each user prefers each of the $D$ latent factors. Each row $V_j$ can be thought of as how much each item can be described by each of the latent factors. In order to make a recommendation, we need a suitable prediction function which maps a user preference vector $U_i$ and an item latent factor vector $V_j$ to a predicted ranking. The choice of this prediction function is an important modeling decision, and a variety of prediction functions have been used. Perhaps the most common is the dot product of the two vectors, $U_i \\cdot V_j$ {cite:p}`koren2009matrixfactorization`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand CF techniques, let us explore a particular example. Imagine we are seeking to recommend movies using a model which infers five latent factors, $V_j$, for $j = 1,2,3,4,5$. In reality, the latent factors are often unexplainable in a straightforward manner, and most models make no attempt to understand what information is being captured by each factor.  However, for the purposes of explanation, let us assume the five latent factors might end up capturing the film profile we were discussing above. So our five latent factors are: moody, light-hearted, cinematic, dialogue, and budget. Then for a particular user $i$, imagine we infer a preference vector $U_i = <0.5, 0.1, 1.5, 1.1, 0.3>$. Also, for a particular item $j$, we infer these values for the latent factors: $V_j = <0.5, 1.5, 1.25, 0.8, 0.9>$. Using the dot product as the prediction function, we would calculate 3.425 as the ranking for that item, which is more or less a neutral preference given our 1 to 5 rating scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0.5 \\times 0.5 + 0.1 \\times 1.5 + 1.5 \\times 1.25 + 1.1 \\times 0.8 + 0.3 \\times 0.9 = 3.425 $$"

We can clearly see this in our graph of the movie means above. We'll attempt to capture these general trends through per-user and per-movie rating means.

    "## Probabilistic Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic Matrix Factorization {cite:p}`mnih2008advances` is a probabilistic approach to the collaborative filtering problem that takes a Bayesian perspective. The ratings $R$ are modeled as draws from a Gaussian distribution.  The mean for $R_{ij}$ is $U_i V_j^T$. The precision $\\alpha$ is a fixed parameter that reflects the uncertainty of the estimations; the normal distribution is commonly reparameterized in terms of precision, which is the inverse of the variance. Complexity is controlled by placing zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors on $U$ and $V$. In other words, each row of $U$ is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian with mean $\\mu = 0$ and precision which is some multiple of the identity matrix $I$. Those multiples are $\\alpha_U$ for $U$ and $\\alpha_V$ for $V$. So our model is defined by:\n",

    "Given small precision parameters, the priors on $U$ and $V$ ensure our latent variables do not grow too far from 0. This prevents overly strong user preferences and item factor compositions from being learned. This is commonly known as complexity control, where the complexity of the model here is measured by the magnitude of the latent variables. Controlling complexity like this helps prevent overfitting, which allows the model to generalize better for unseen data. We must also choose an appropriate $\\alpha$ value for the normal distribution for $R$. So the challenge becomes choosing appropriate values for $\\alpha_U$, $\\alpha_V$, and $\\alpha$. This challenge can be tackled with the soft weight-sharing methods discussed by {cite:t}`nowlan1992simplifying`. However, for the purposes of this analysis, we will stick to using point estimates obtained from our data."

In this case, we have high-dimensional samples, so we need to find a way to approximate them. One way was proposed by {cite:t}`salakhutdinov2008bayesian`. We can calculate the Frobenius norms of $U$ and $V$ at each step and monitor those for convergence. This essentially gives us some idea when the average magnitude of the latent variables is stabilizing. The equations for the Frobenius norms of $U$ and $V$ are shown below.

Thus without constraints, the solutions are at best symmetrical, at worse identical under any rotation, in any case subject to label switching. In fact if we sample from multiple chains we will see large $\\hat{R}$ indicating the sampler is exploring different solutions in different part of parameter space."

    "We have some interesting results here. As expected, our MCMC sampler provides lower error on the training set. However, it seems it does so at the cost of overfitting the data. This results in a decrease in test RMSE as compared to the MAP, even though it is still much better than our best baseline. So why might this be the case? Recall that we used point estimates for our precision parameters $\\alpha_U$ and $\\alpha_V$ and we chose a fixed precision $\\alpha$. It is quite likely that by doing this, we constrained our posterior in a way that biased it towards the training data. In reality, the variance in the user ratings and the movie ratings is unlikely to be equal to the means of sample variances we used. Also, the most reasonable observation precision $\\alpha$ is likely different as well."

    "We set out to predict user preferences for unseen movies. First we discussed the intuitive notion behind the user-user and item-item neighborhood approaches to collaborative filtering. Then we formalized our intuitions. With a firm understanding of our problem context, we moved on to exploring our subset of the Movielens data. After discovering some general patterns, we defined three baseline methods: uniform random, global mean, and mean of means. With the goal of besting our baseline methods, we implemented the basic version of Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) using `pymc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results demonstrate that the mean of means method is our best baseline on our prediction task. As expected, we are able to obtain a significant decrease in RMSE using the PMF MAP estimate obtained via Powell optimization. We illustrated one way to monitor convergence of an MCMC sampler with a high-dimensionality sampling space using the Frobenius norms of the sampled variables. The traceplots using this method seem to indicate that our sampler converged to the posterior. Results using this posterior showed that attempting to improve the MAP estimation using MCMC sampling actually overfit the training data and increased test RMSE. This was likely caused by the constraining of the posterior via fixed precision parameters $\\alpha$, $\\alpha_U$, and $\\alpha_V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a followup to this analysis, it would be interesting to also implement the logistic and constrained versions of PMF. We expect both models to outperform the basic PMF model. We could also implement the fully Bayesian version of PMF (BPMF) {cite:p}`salakhutdinov2008bayesian`, which places hyperpriors on the model parameters to automatically learn ideal mean and precision parameters for $U$ and $V$. This would likely resolve the issue we faced in this analysis. We would expect BPMF to improve upon the MAP estimation produced here by learning more suitable hyperparameters and parameters. For a basic (but working!) implementation of BPMF in `pymc`, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/macks22/00a17b1d374dfc267a9a).\n",

    "If you made it this far, then congratulations! You now have some idea of how to build a basic recommender system. These same ideas and methods can be used on many different recommendation tasks. Items can be movies, products, advertisements, courses, or even other people. Any time you can build yourself a user-item matrix with user preferences in the cells, you can use these types of collaborative filtering algorithms to predict the missing values. If you want to learn more about recommender systems, the first reference is a good place to start."
