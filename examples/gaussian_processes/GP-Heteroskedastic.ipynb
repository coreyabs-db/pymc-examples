    "We can typically divide the sources of uncertainty in our models into two categories. \"Aleatoric\" uncertainty (from the Latin word for dice or randomness) arises from the intrinsic variability of our system. \"Epistemic\" uncertainty (from the Greek word for knowledge) arises from how our observations are placed throughout the domain of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Process (GP) models are a powerful tool to capture both of these sources of uncertainty. By considering the distribution of all functions that satisfy the conditions specified by the covariance kernel and the data, these models express low epistemic uncertainty near the observations and high epistemic uncertainty farther away. To incorporate aleatoric uncertainty, the standard GP model assumes additive white noise with constant magnitude throughout the domain. However, this \"homoskedastic\" model can do a poor job of representing your system if some regions have higher variance than others. Among other fields, this is particularly common in the experimental sciences, where varying experimental parameters can affect both the magnitude and the variability of the response. Explicitly incorporating the dependence (and inter-dependence) of noise on the inputs and outputs can lead to a better understanding of the mean behavior as well as a more informative landscape for optimization, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will work through several approaches to heteroskedastic modeling with GPs. We'll use toy data that represents (independent) repeated measurements at a range of input values on a system where the magnitude of the noise increases with the response variable. We'll start with simplistic modeling approaches such as fitting a GP to the mean at each point weighted by the variance at each point (which may be useful if individual measurements are taken via a method with known uncertainty), contrasting this with a typical homoskedastic GP. We'll then construct a model that uses one latent GP to model the response mean and a second (independent) latent GP to model the response variance. To improve the efficiency and scalability of this model, we'll re-formulate it in a sparse framework. Finally, we'll use a coregionalization kernel to allow correlation between the noise and the mean response."

    "So far, we've modeled the mean and noise of our system as independent. However, there may be scenarios where we expect them to be correlated, for example if higher measurement values are expected to have greater noise. Here, we'll explicitly model this correlation through a covariance function that is a Kronecker product of the spatial kernel we've used previously and a `Coregion` kernel, as suggested by Bill Engels [here](https://discourse.pymc.io/t/coregionalization-model-for-two-separable-multidimensional-gaussian-process/2550/4). This is an implementation of the Linear Model of Coregionalization, which treats each correlated GP as a linear combination of a small number of independent basis functions, which are themselves GPs. We first add a categorical dimension to the domain of our observations to indicate whether the mean or variance is being considered, then unpack the respective components before feeding them into a `Normal` likelihood as above."

    "The three latent approaches shown here varied in their complexity and efficiency, but ultimately produced very similar regression surfaces, as shown below. All three displayed a nuanced understanding of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. It's worth noting that we had to increase `target_accept` from the default 0.8 to 0.95 to avoid an excessive number of divergences, but this has the downside of slowing down NUTS evaluations. Sampling times could be decreased by reducing `target_accept`, at the expense of potentially biased inference due to divergences, or by further reducing the number of inducing points used in the sparse approximations. Inspecting the convergence statistics for each method, all had low r_hat values of 1.01 or below but the LMC model showed low effective sample sizes for some parameters, in particular the `ess_tail` for the η and ℓ parameters. To have confidence in the 95% CI bounds for this model, we should run the sampling for more iterations, ideally at least until the smallest `ess_tail` is above 200 but the higher the better."
