    "# Gaussian Process (GP) smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "This example deals with the case when we want to **smooth** the observed data points $(x_i, y_i)$ of some 1-dimensional function $y=f(x)$, by finding the new values $(x_i, y'_i)$ such that the new data is more \"smooth\" (see more on the definition of smoothness through allocation of variance in the model description below) when moving along the $x$ axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we are **not** dealing with the problem of interpolating the function $y=f(x)$ at the unknown values of $x$. Such problem would be called \"regression\" not \"smoothing\", and will be considered in other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume the functional dependency between $x$ and $y$ is **linear** then, by making the independence and normality assumptions about the noise, we can infer a straight line that approximates the dependency between the variables, i.e. perform a linear regression. We can also fit more complex functional dependencies (like quadratic, cubic, etc), if we know the functional form of the dependency in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the **functional form** of $y=f(x)$ is **not always known in advance**, and it might be hard to choose which one to fit, given the data. For example, you wouldn't necessarily know which function to use, given the following observed data. Assume you haven't seen the formula that generated it:"
